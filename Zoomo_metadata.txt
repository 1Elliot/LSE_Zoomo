LSE_DA_EP_Zoomofile name: Zoomo_metadata.txt Ð metadata for the Zoomo Employer Project files combined.                              	The raw IoT data is: Zoomo_IoT.xlsx 	The labelled data includes data from the mobile Rider app and the onboard device.	The following data sets were taken from the mobile phone Rider app:				accel_1_26_05_2022.csv				accel_2_26_05_2022.csv				accel_3_26_05_2022.csv				accel_4_26_05_2022.csv			The following data sets were taken from the onboard device:								Accelerometer: 				accel_6_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv				accel_7_fast_and_stop_31_05_2022.csv				accel_8_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv				accel_9_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv				accel_10_normal_ride.csv				Gyroscope:				gyro_1_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv				gyro_2_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv				gyro_3_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv				gyro_4_throwing_bike_31_05_2022.csv				gyro_5_throwing_bike_31_05_2022.csv**************************************************************************************NOTE:The speed and accelerometer share a relationship where changes in both can determine an event depending on the magnitude of the values.***************************************************************************************ASSUMPTIONS:Note that not all thresholding and debounce values (debouncing is getting rid of the spikes in the data) are indicative of the end product solution. They are meant to simply communicate the various use cases and to provide a starting point for problem solving.Ax is in riding direction Ð forward/reverse, relative to the rider sitting on the bike.Az is up/down, with positive vector in line with gravity.Ay is left/right, relative to the rider sitting on the bike.Amag is equal to (Ax^2+Ay^2+Az^2)^.5. Amag is the magnitude of acceleration (XYZ acceleration magnitude). Amag saves calculation time and is used for crashing/falling.***************************************************************************************General information regarding Zoomo_IoT.xlsx1) All readings are from the same bike and the same rider.2) Data definitionsax = acceleration in x axisay = acceleration in y axisaz = acceleration in z axiswx = gyroscope in x axiswy = gyroscope in y axiswz = gyroscope in z axis3) Bike mishandling events and calculations1. Skidding:IF ((Braking == ON) && (Speed >5 km/h) && (Ax > threshold)) THEN, Skidding is TRUE. Debounced over 0.2 sec should not incur a false positive or report the same event multiple times.2. Dropping the vehicle on its side: IF ((Speed <5 km/h) && (Ay >> Az) && (Az < threshold)) THEN, Vehicle drop is TRUE. Debounced over 1 sec should not incur a false positive or report the same event multiple times.3. Crashing the vehicle into an object:IF ((Speed >5 km/h) && (Ay | Ax >> Az) && (Amag > threshold)) THEN, Vehicle crash is TRUE.Debounced over 0.2 sec should not incur a false positive or report the same event multiple times.4. Falling off the vehicle:IF ((Speed >5 km/h) && (Ay | Ax >> Az) && (Amag > threshold)) THEN, Rider fell off vehicle is TRUE. Debounced over 1 sec should not incur a false positive or report the same event multiple times.5. Swerving:IF ((Speed > 5 km/h) && (Ax >> threshold) && (Gx >> threshold)).6. Heavy braking:IF ((Braking == ON) && (Speed >5 km/h) && (Ax > threshold)). Debounced over 0.2 sec should not incur a false positive or report the same event multiple times.***************************************************************************************General information regarding the labelled data sets1) SourcesAll readings from the same bike and the same riderMobile App with accelerometer deviceOnboard device using onboard sensors on the bike 2) Data definitionstime 		= timestamp of observation (e.g. 2918471, 2918569)timestamp	= timestamp of observation (e.g. 18:10:09:02, 18:10:09:118)X		= acceleration in x-axis or gyroscope in x-axisY		= acceleration in y-axis or gyroscope in y-axisZ		= acceleration in z-axis or gyroscope in z-axisX_f		= acceleration in x axis; filteredY_f		= acceleration in y axis; filteredZ_f		= acceleration in y axis; filteredAX		= acceleration in x axisAY		= acceleration in y axisAZ		= acceleration in z axisfAX		= filtered AXfAY		= filtered AYfAZ		= filtered AZmode		= accelerometer typedata		= raw data set attributes3) Events jumping on a bump or going up a curb		accel_6_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv	accel_8_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv	accel_9_curb_up_31_05_2022.csvfast and then stopping abruptly		accel_7_fast_and_stop_31_05_2022.csvjumping on a bump or going up a curb		gyro_1_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv	gyro_2_curb_up_31_05_2022.csv	gyro_3_curb_up_31_05_2022.csvthrowing the bike to the floor (from the left and right side)		gyro_4_throwing_bike_31_05_2022.csv	gyro_5_throwing_bike_31_05_2022.csv******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
